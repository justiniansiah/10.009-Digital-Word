q.1

b = a # (i)c = a[:] # (ii)d = copy.deepcopy(a) # (iii)

(i) b and a share the same data; no data replication; change in b will propagate to a (and vice versa)
(ii) only data replication at the top level.  c and a share all data except the top level.  
(iii) data replication at all level. no data sharing between d and a.  change in d will not affect a (and vice versa)

q.2

no update of leftObstacle, rightObstacle inside while loop.

should have: 

  leftObstacle, rightObstacle = finch.obstacle()

inside the while loop
